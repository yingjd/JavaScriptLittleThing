<p id="p1">Problem 1:  Identify which of the following are valid Javascript types (i.e. can be returned as
output from the typeof() function). For each valid type provide an example using
console.log(typeof( ... )).

<p answer> The following are Javascipt types: boolean, function, number, object and string. 
<script>
	function myFunction(p1, p2){
		return p1 * p2;
	}
	console.log(typesof(true));
	console.log(typesof(myFunction));
	console.log(typesof(77));
	console.log(typesof(null));
	console.log(typesof("I love coding"));
</script>
</p>


<p id="p2">Problem 2: Each of the following expressions contains improper JSON: calling
JSON.parse(...) will result in an error. For each example, describe the error and
provide a fixed version. Use the JSON.parse function to demonstrate that it works.
Some may contain more than one error.
<script>
var x = 100;
</script>
</p>



<p id="p3">Problem 3:  Write a JSON expression that represents a list. This list should contain at least
three objects. Each object should have at least three properties. The value of one 
property should be a number, the value of another should be a boolean, and value
of a third should be a list of strings. You may define the contents in any way you
choose and add additional properties as long as we can easily verify that the
required elements are present.
<script>
var x = 100;
</script>
